The windows were boarded up, and the door was left ajar. Sarah hesitated, but James encouraged her to be brave. They stepped inside, and the door creaked shut behind them.\n\nThe first thing they noticed was the musty smell that filled the air. They coughed and rubbed their eyes, trying to clear their throats. As they looked around, they saw that the furniture was covered in dust and cobwebs. The floorboards creaked under their feet, and they could hear strange noises coming from the walls.\n\nSarah was about to turn and leave when James grabbed her arm. \"Look!\" he whispered, pointing to a staircase in the corner of the room. The steps seemed to be moving on their own, as if someone was walking up and down them.\n\nSarah gasped, and James laughed. \"It's just the wind,\" he said. \"But come on, let's keep exploring. Maybe there's something interesting upstairs.\"\n\nThey made their way up the staircase, and as they reached the top, they heard a loud bang from behind one of the doors. Sarah screamed, and James grabbed her hand. They slowly opened the door, and as they stepped inside, they saw a ghostly figure standing in the middle of the room.\n\nThe ghost was tall and thin, with long, flowing hair and a white robe. It looked at them with cold, empty eyes, and Sarah felt a shiver run down her spine. James, however, was fascinated. \"Wow,\" he whispered. \"This is amazing. I've never seen a real ghost before.\"\n\nSarah tried to pull him away, but he was too captivated by the apparition.

However, the time has come for us to face the reality that gun control measures are necessary to prevent gun violence and protect our communities.\n\nThe statistics speak for themselves. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were over 40,000 gun deaths in the United States in 2019, including homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings. This is a staggering number that cannot be ignored. We cannot continue to allow easy access to firearms without taking steps to prevent gun violence.\n\nOne of the main arguments for gun control is that it will reduce the number of gun deaths. Studies have shown that countries with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun violence. For example, Canada has a lower rate of gun ownership and a lower rate of gun-related deaths than the United States. This is not a coincidence.\n\nAnother argument for gun control is that it will make our communities safer. When guns are readily available, it is more likely that someone will use them in a violent act. By implementing stricter gun control measures, we can reduce the likelihood of gun violence and make our communities safer for everyone.\n\nOf course, there are those who argue that gun control will infringe on their constitutional rights. However, the Second Amendment was intended to protect the right to bear arms for the defense of ourselves and our communities, not to allow anyone to carry any weapon they want. We must find a balance between protecting our rights and protecting our communities from gun violence.\n\nIn conclusion, the time has come for us to take action on gun control. We cannot continue to ignore the statistics and the evidence that gun violence is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. We must work together to find a solution that protects our rights and our communities from gun violence."}, {"instruction": "Given a list of strings, return the list with the strings that have at least one digit.", "input": "strings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"123\", \"abc\", \"456\", \"def\"]", "output": "[123, 456, '123', '456']\n\nExplanation:\nThe function takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list containing only the strings that have at least one digit.

It is an innate mechanism that has been present in animals and humans for thousands of years. When an individual perceives a threat, their body releases stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which trigger a physical response. This response includes an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, as well as a heightened sense of alertness and focus.\n\nThe \"fight\" part of the response refers to the individual's ability to physically defend themselves against the perceived threat. This may involve physical force or verbal confrontation. The \"flight\" part of the response refers to the individual's ability to escape from the perceived threat. This may involve running away or finding a way to remove themselves from the situation.\n\nIn modern times, the \"fight or flight\" response is often triggered by stressors such as work, school, or relationships. While this response can be helpful in certain situations, such as a physical attack, it can also lead to negative health effects when experienced chronicly. Chronic stress can increase the risk of developing anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, and other health problems.

Stocks: Stocks represent ownership in a company, and the value of the investment rises and falls with the price of the stock. Stocks have the potential for high returns but also come with a higher level of risk.\n\n2. Bonds: Bonds are loans made to a government or corporation, which promises to repay the borrowed funds with interest over a specified period. Bonds are generally considered to be safer investments than stocks, but they also offer lower returns.\n\n3. Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are a type of investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Mutual funds offer the potential for higher returns than individual stocks or bonds, but also come with a higher level of risk.\n\n4. Real Estate: Real estate investments involve purchasing physical property to generate income or capital gains. This can include rental properties, flipping houses for a profit, or investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs). Real estate investments can offer both income and long-term appreciation, but also come with the risk of property damage, vacancy, and management issues.\n\n5. Commodities: Commodities are raw materials such as gold, oil, and agricultural products that are bought and sold on markets. Commodity investments can offer diversification and protection against inflation, but also come with the risk of price fluctuations and market volatility.\n\nIt's important to carefully consider the risks and rewards of any investment before making a decision.

Every year, millions of tons of plastic end up in our oceans, waterways, and landfills. This waste not only harms wildlife and pollutes our ecosystems, but it also affects us, as the consequences of such pollution ultimately come back to haunt us in the form of health hazards and economic repercussions.\n\nThe importance of reducing plastic waste cannot be overstated. The first step in reducing plastic waste is to minimize our use of single-use plastics. This includes plastic bags, straws, water bottles, and utensils. By switching to reusable alternatives, we can drastically reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in our environment.\n\nSecondly, we must improve our recycling habits. While recycling is not a perfect solution, it is an important step in reducing plastic waste. By properly sorting and disposing of our recyclables, we can ensure that they are processed and repurposed, rather than ending up in a landfill.\n\nFinally, we must hold companies accountable for their role in the plastic waste crisis. Many companies produce plastic products with little regard for the environmental impact, and it is time for governments to impose regulations and penalties on these companies to encourage more sustainable practices.\n\nIn conclusion, reducing plastic waste is crucial for the health of our planet. By taking small steps in our daily lives, and by demanding change from our governments and corporations, we can make a big difference in mitigating the plastic waste crisis.
