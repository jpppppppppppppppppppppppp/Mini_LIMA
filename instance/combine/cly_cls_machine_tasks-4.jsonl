The output JSON data contains the predicted temperature and weather conditions for the same location.\n\nTo predict the temperature and weather conditions, we can use a simple algorithm that takes into account the average temperature and weather conditions for each day in the forecast period. In this case, the forecast period is one day, so we can simply take the average of the temperature and weather conditions for that day.\n\nFor the temperature, we can take the average of the three forecasts as follows:\n```python\ntemperature_sum = 50 + 55 + 60\ntemperature_avg = temperature_sum / 3\n```\nThis gives us an average temperature of 57.5.\n\nFor the weather conditions, we can take the mode of the three forecasts as follows:\n```python\nweather_counts = {\"Sunny\": 1, \"Cloudy\": 1, \"Rainy\": 1}\nweather_mode = max(weather_counts, key=weather_counts.get)\n```\nThis gives us a mode of \""}
