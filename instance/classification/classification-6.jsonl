However, it has also been linked to several negative effects on mental health.\n\nStudies have shown that excessive use of social media can lead to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. It can also contribute to social isolation and loneliness, particularly among young people who may feel pressure to present a perfect image online.\n\nIt is important to be aware of these potential negative effects and take steps to mitigate them.
