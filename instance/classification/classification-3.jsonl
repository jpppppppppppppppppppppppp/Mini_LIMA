The study involved a group of participants over the age of 60 who were randomly assigned to either an exercise group or a control group. The exercise group participated in a structured exercise program for 12 weeks, while the control group did not participate in any exercise. Cognitive function was assessed using a battery of tests at the beginning and end of the study. The results showed that the exercise group had significant improvements in cognitive function compared to the control group. The authors conclude that exercise can be an effective intervention to improve cognitive function in older adults.", "output": "Original Research"}
