It was a turning point in history, as it marked the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany.\n4. The September 11 attacks: These were a series of terrorist attacks on the United States that occurred on September 11, 2001. The attacks resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people and were a turning point in U.S. policy, leading to the War on Terror.\n5.

It has had a profound impact on nearly every aspect of modern life, from social media to e-commerce to online education.\n6.
